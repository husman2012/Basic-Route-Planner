# Basic-Route-Planner
Basic entry-level program to refresh C++ skills. Route Planner that takes a board object and determines the best route from start to end using A* search algorithm.

During program output, obstacles for the agent are displayed as mountains, open nodes are displayed by 0's, goals are flags, start point is the traffic light and the agent's route is the car. User may modify the board as needed by using 1's to place mountains and 0's to place open nodes.

Further improvements will be added as project progresses.
